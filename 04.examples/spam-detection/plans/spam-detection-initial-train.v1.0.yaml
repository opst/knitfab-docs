# inputs:
#   List of filepath and Tags as Input of this Plans.
#   1 or more Inputs are needed.
#   Each filepath should be absolute. Tags should be formatted in "key:value"-style.

# active (optional, mutable):
#   To suspend executing Runs by this Plan, set false explicitly.
#   If missing or null, it is assumed as true.
active: true

# resource (optional, mutable):
# Specify the resource , cpu or memory for example, requirements for this Plan.
# This value can be changed after the Plan is applied.

# There can be other resources. For them, ask your administrator.

# (advanced note: These values are passed to container.resource.limits in kubernetes.)
resources:
  
  # cpu (optional; default = 1):
  #   Specify the CPU resource requirements for this Plan.
  #   This value means "how many cores" the plan will use.
  #   This can be a fraction, like "0.5" or "500m" (= 500 millicore) for a half of a core.
  cpu: 1
  
  # memory (optional; default = 1Gi):
  #   Specify the memory resource requirements for this Plan.
  #   This value means "how many bytes" the plan will use.
  #   You can use suffixes like "Ki", "Mi", "Gi" for kibi-(1024), mebi-(1024^2), gibi-(1024^3) bytes, case sensitive.
  #   For example, "1Gi" means 1 gibibyte.
  #   If you omit the suffix, it is assumed as bytes.
  memory: 1Gi


# # on_node (optional):
# #   Specify the node where this Plan is executed.
# #
# #   For each level (may, prefer and must), you can put node labels or taints in "key=value" format.
# #   Labels show a node characteristic, and taints show a node restriction.
# #   Ask your administrator for the available labels/taints.
# #
# #   By default (= empty), this plan is executed on any node, if the node does not taint.
# on_node:
#   # may: (optional)
#   #   Allow to execute this plan on nodes with these taints, put here.
#   may:
#     - "label-a=value1"
#     - "label-b=value2"
#
#   # prefer: (optional)
#   #   Execute this plan on nodes with these labels & taints, if possible.
#   prefer:
#     - "vram=large"
#
#   # must: (optional)
#   #   Always execute this plan on nodes with these labels & taints
#   #   (taints on node can be subset of this list).
#   #
#   #   If no node matches, runs of the plan will be scheduled but not started.
#   must:
#     - "accelarator=gpu"
#
# # service_account (optional, mutable):
# #   Specify the service account to run this Plan.
# #   If missing or null, the service account is not used.
